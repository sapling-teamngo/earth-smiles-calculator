                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>This research proposes the adaptation and implementation of semicircular bunds (earth smiles) for water harvesting in the semi-arid region of Al Mafraq, Jordan. Using design parameters from WOCAT (World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies) methodologies, we developed an optimized system tailored to local conditions of low rainfall (150-200 mm/year), loamy soils, and moderate slopes (3-8%). Based on computational modeling and WOCAT principles from Benin, we expect significant improvements in water retention and agricultural productivity. The projected outcomes include 40-45% reduction in water runoff and 25-30% increase in soil moisture retention. The research provides a theoretical framework for implementing semicircular bunds in similar semi-arid regions worldwide.</p>

                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>Water scarcity poses significant challenges for agricultural productivity in semi-arid regions like Al Mafraq, Jordan. With annual rainfall between 150-200 mm and increasing climate variability, innovative water harvesting techniques are essential for sustainable agriculture. Semicircular bunds, also known as "earth smiles" or "half-moons," have proven effective in West Africa for capturing runoff and improving soil moisture (WOCAT, 2023).</p>
                
                <p>This research proposes the adaptation of WOCAT methodology for Jordanian conditions, addressing the specific challenges of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lower annual rainfall compared to West African benchmarks</li>
                    <li>Different soil characteristics and composition</li>
                    <li>Local agricultural practices and crop patterns</li>
                    <li>Socio-economic constraints of small-scale farmers</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="expected-results">
                    <strong>Research Approach:</strong> This study utilizes computational modeling and WOCAT-based calculations to develop optimized design parameters for semicircular bunds in the Al Mafraq region, with projected outcomes based on established hydrological principles.
